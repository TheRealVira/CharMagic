# CharMagic

CharMagic is a open source text decryption/encryption, which curses your Filesystem!:sparkles:

## Features

You're not only able to curse pure strings, you could even curse pure files! And if thats not enough, you could write your own curses.

## How to write a plug-in for CharMagic

* Add the CharMagicLib to your project (or simple download the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CharMagicLib/1.0.0)) :arrow_down:
* Basic implementation here :innocent:
* Compile your plug-in library :boom:
* Put your lib into the "Plugins" folder :eyes:
* Hope that it'll work :sweat_smile:
* Curse your files! :smiling_imp:

## Note:

I've implemented the "TestingPurpose" attribute, which allows us to create curses which aren't working yet and which should only show up in "Debug" mode.

## Finale thoghts

This was a pretty small, fast to handle and cool looking project!

Again - Shoutouts to [ButchersBoy](https://github.com/ButchersBoy) and as always:

Happy coding! :necktie:
